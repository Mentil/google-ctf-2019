This task only provides the address `readme.ctfcompetition.com 1337`. When connected, we are presented with a shell. Typing `help` shows
```
> help
Alien's shell
Type program names and arguments, and hit enter.
The following are built in:
  cd
  help
  exit
Use the man command for information on other programs.
```
Trying something like `ls` shows us two items `ORME.flag` and `README.flag` seems like there might be two flags. Trying to execute files shows `permission denied`. Lets see what programs are available.

I'm not too familiar with all the tools but one of them probably allows us to access to file. Going down the list, I saw `busybox` which seems promising. However running busybox shows the message `busybox can not be called for alien reasons.` So it seems that this may be our target.

Running `ls -l`, the `README.flag` file is readable but tools like `cat` or `tail` did not exist. So I went down the list for a tool that could possibly read files. Something I learned was the `makemime` tool because after reading up on it, it appears to be able to read a file. Running
> makemime  README.flag

Gives us:
```
> makemime README.flag                                                  
Mime-Version: 1.0                                                       
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="245967688-281105878-1932398038"
                                                                        
--245967688-281105878-1932398038                                        
Content-Type: application/octet-stream; charset=us-ascii                
Content-Disposition: inline; filename="README.flag"                     
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

--245967688-281105878-1932398038--                                      
```

That string `Q1RGezRsbF9ENDc0XzVoNGxsX0IzX0ZyMzN9Cg==` looks like base64, and indeed decoding it gives us `CTF{4ll_D474_5h4ll_B3_Fr33}`. Now trying it for the other flag just left a blank screen so it was back to figuring out how to open busybox. At least that was the only thing I could think of. We also have to get permissions to access to file. I found a hint for this one which is the `env` command. The `env` command is able to execute a program and running `env busybox` worked. Now all I had to do was chmod and add read permissions
```
> env busybox chmod +r ORME.flag                                       
> makemime ORME.flag                                                   
Mime-Version: 1.0                                                      
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="790050884-595716176-916811417"
                                                                       
--790050884-595716176-916811417                                        
Content-Type: application/octet-stream; charset=us-ascii               
Content-Disposition: inline; filename="ORME.flag"                      
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64                                      
                                                                       
Q1RGe1RoM3IzXzFzXzRsdzR5NV80TjA3aDNyX1c0eX0K                           
--790050884-595716176-916811417--                                      
```

Another base64 decode and we get the flag `CTF{Th3r3_1s_4lw4y5_4N07h3r_W4y}`
